    <p>Hello, My Name is Damar Ellis! I was born and raised in Aliquippa, PA but I currently reside in Durham, NC.
      It took me sometime to figure out what I wanted to do with my career and after some thought, I decided to attend a full stack web development bootcamp at UNC-Chapel Hill.
      Afterwords, I hope to get an opportunity somewhere where I can hone my skills and continue to get better.</p>
